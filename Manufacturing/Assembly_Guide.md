## Final Assembly Step: Heat-Set Inserts
1. Use a soldering iron set to 260°C.
2. Gently press the M3 Brass Inserts into the pre-printed holes in the 'keyboard_case.scad'.
3. Ensure they are flush with the plastic surface to prevent the 'Bottom Plate' from wobbling.

## ⚠️ Critical: eDP Ribbon Management
- The AUO 14.5" screen uses a 40-pin I-PEX connector.
- **Strain Relief:** Once the cable is seated, apply a small strip of **Kapton Tape** across the connector.
- **Routing:** Thread the ribbon through the 'cable_clips' integrated into the chassis floor. This prevents the cable from touching the hot Pi 5 Active Cooler.
